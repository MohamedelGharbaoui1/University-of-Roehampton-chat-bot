## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Student database not found"**
   - Ensure `student_modules_with_pdfs.xlsx` is in the project root
   - Check file permissions

2. **"Document not found"**
   - Verify PDF files are in the `data/` folder
   - Check filename matches exactly with Excel file

3. **"OpenAI API key missing"**
   - Add your API key to the `.env` file
   - Ensure the file is not committed to version control

4. **Authentication failures**
