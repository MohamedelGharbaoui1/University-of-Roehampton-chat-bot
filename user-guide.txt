🧠 Chatbot User Guide – Roehampton Coursework Assistant

This chatbot is designed to help Roehampton University students with either Ethics documents or Coursework based on assigned PDFs for each module.

⸻

🟢 Bot Flow Overview (Step-by-Step)
	1.	Welcome Message
The chatbot should greet the user and ask the following question first:
➤ “Hi there! Would you like help with an Ethics document or University Coursework?”
	•	If the user selects Ethics Document → Go into that specific workflow (not detailed here).
	•	If the user selects University Coursework → Continue to step 2.

⸻

	2.	Ask for Roehampton Student ID
➤ “Please enter your Roehampton University Student ID:”
(This can be used for authentication/logging if needed.)

⸻

	3.	Ask for Unique Code
➤ “Great! Now please enter your unique code to continue:”
(This can be for extra security or to load user-specific resources.)

⸻

	4.	Ask for Module
➤ “Which module would you like help with?”
Example modules:
	•	Data Science & AI
	•	Business Analytics
	•	Marketing Strategy
(Display a list or dropdown of available modules if possible.)

⸻

	5.	Load PDFs for the Selected Module
Once the user selects a module, the bot should reference the assigned PDFs related to that module.

⸻

	6.	Ask for Coursework Help
➤ “Which coursework from this module would you like help with?”
	•	Display list or options based on the module’s PDF contents or coursework IDs/titles.

	2.	🧾 “Please enter your Roehampton Student ID:”

📎 Notes for Devs / Fix Suggestions:
	•	Ensure every step has input validation (e.g. Student ID must be numeric or alphanumeric).
	•	Map each module to its relevant PDFs so the bot can access and read from them.
	•	Optional: Allow natural language input (e.g., user says “Help with Marketing strategy CW1”) and the bot can parse and skip steps.
	•	Make sure the user can go back or restart the flow at any point.
